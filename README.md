# Bayesian Inference using Stan: CSTAT workshop

## Each project consists of:

### 1) an .R file,
### 2) one or more .stan files and, 
### 3) optionally, .RData files with the outputs

When following each project, make sure to go back to the learning objectives and review the code related to each point

## how to install stan
