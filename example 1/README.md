# First example with Stan in R

1) Download the R file
2) Download the stan file

## Learning objective 1: Understand the basics of stan syntax

Open file *dugongs_linear.stan* and identify the code blocks

## Learning objective 2: Fit a simple regression model using stan
## Learning objective 3: Undertand the structure of a stanfit object and how to extract information from it.
## Learning objective 4: Perform convergence diagnostics and sumaries with stan, bayesplot and shinystan

Follow all the lines in the R code


## learning check:
### Can you identify in the R code the sections corresponding to each learning objective?
### Can you list what code blocks in Stan have NOT been used in this example?
